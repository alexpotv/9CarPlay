"""btsdp_iap_guided — an operator-guided iAP1-over-Bluetooth *hypothesis-testing harness*.

This is a testing-oriented sibling of `btsdp_iap.py`. Same transport (registers the SDP record for
`00000000-deca-fade-deca-deafdecacafe` and accepts the head unit's RFCOMM connection), same iAP1
wire framing (reused directly from `iap1_daemon.py`). The difference: instead of running one fixed
handshake strategy, it walks a numbered list of HYPOTHESES, each of which responds to the head
unit's traffic *differently*, and — because we can launch "HondaLink" from the head unit ourselves
but have NO real iPhone to compare against — it prompts the operator to launch HondaLink for each
hypothesis and records what the head unit actually did, so the whole batch can be analyzed offline
afterward.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the RE that motivated it, 2026-08-11)
------------------------------------------------------
The BT 1-15 daemon rewrites were built on the belief that the head unit's ADCL layer DROPS our
General ACK for StartIDPS because the acked command ID (0x38) exceeds a `< 0x19` bound in
`AplReceiveGeneralAckCallback`. Re-decompiling that callback AND its two siblings
(`AplReceiveSimpleAckCallback`, `AplReceiveExtendedAckCallback`) showed all three are byte-for-byte
identical — `if (param_3 < 0x19) {forward} else {FATAL "ubStatus NG"; drop}`. Because the three
lingoes have totally different command-ID ranges but share the SAME 0x19 bound, `param_3` is the
lingo-independent **ACK status byte**, not the acked command ID (the FATAL string even names it
"ubStatus"). So a status-0x00 ACK is always forwarded, whatever it acks — our StartIDPS ACK is NOT
dropped, and the accept-vs-refuse-StartIDPS thrashing was chasing a misread. The real reason the
head unit loops StartIDPS / fails to launch the app is now genuinely open, which is exactly what
this harness exists to pin down empirically. See references/cr-v/iap.md, "ADCL ACK gate re-analysed
(2026-08-11)" for the full trace.

HOW TO RUN (on the Pi, as root, alongside hfp_ag.py after setup_bt_phone.sh + pairing)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    sudo python3 btsdp_iap_guided.py

Then follow the on-screen prompts. For each hypothesis it will:
  1. tell you what it's testing and what a positive result would look like,
  2. wait for you to press Enter to "arm" it,
  3. ask you to launch HondaLink on the head unit and observe,
  4. ask you to classify the outcome (menu) and type any on-screen error text,
  5. move to the next hypothesis (you can repeat, skip, or quit at any prompt).

Everything the head unit sends/receives is logged, tagged by hypothesis, to a timestamped JSONL
file (`guided_results_<suffix>.jsonl`) plus a human-readable `guided_results_<suffix>.txt` summary.
Hand those two files back for analysis.

# ===========================================================================
# Hypotheses
# ===========================================================================
# Each hypothesis is a small bundle of behavior *flags* consumed by respond_to_packet() below.
# Keeping them declarative (rather than full handler overrides) keeps the matrix easy to read and
# extend — each hypothesis differs only in a handful of decision points.
#
#   start_idps : how we answer StartIDPS (cmd 0x38). "accept" -> General ACK status 0x00;
#                "reject" -> ACK status 0x04; "ignore" -> no reply.
#   sync       : outgoing framing — "short" (bare 0x55, what the head unit transmits) or "full"
#                (0xFF 0x55).
#   run_idps_body : answer SetFIDTokenValues (0x39) and EndIDPS (0x3B) to drive IDPS to completion.
#   init_auth  : after IDPS, initiate + carry MFi device authentication, accepting whatever comes.
#   opt11_mode : how we answer cmd 0x11 (the head unit's iPod-options request; firmware
#                "RetiPodOutOption"). "unknown_id" -> ACK status 0x05 (what round 1 sent);
#                "ack_success" -> ACK status 0x00; "ret_options" -> a speculative RetiPodOptions
#                reply (cmd 0x12 = the natural Get(0x11)/Ret(0x12) pairing), echoing the request's
#                2-byte transID + `general_options` as an 8-byte big-endian field. The 0x12 command
#                id and payload shape are a GUESS pending firmware/live confirmation.
#   general_options : the 8-byte option bitmask we report for General Lingo (0x00) in both the
#                0x4b/0x4c GetiPodOptionsForLingo reply and (for "ret_options") the 0x11 reply.
#                Round 1 used 0x2000 (bit 0x0D, "communication with iPhone OS apps").
#   other_lingo_options : the option bitmask reported for every NON-General lingo the head unit
#                queries (round 1 used 0).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ROUND 1 RESULTS (run 20260811_113447) that motivate this round — see references/cr-v/iap.md
# "Round 1 guided run" for the full analysis. In short, the transaction ID is a global counter and
# all windows are one continuous conversation. Confirmed:
#   * accept-StartIDPS + SHORT sync WORKS: the head unit acked once (0x38x1) and advanced. FULL
#     sync (old H3) made StartIDPS loop; reject/ignore (old H4/H5) loop too. -> short sync + accept
#     is settled; those variables are done and are NOT re-run here.
#   * The real failure is one step later, in IDPS OPTIONS NEGOTIATION. After StartIDPS the head
#     unit runs: cmd 0x11 (iPod-options request) -> GetiPodOptionsForLingo (0x4b) for lingoes
#     0x00,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x0c,0x0e -> EndIDPS with accEndIDPSStatus=0x01 (= IDPS FAILED, reset &
#     retry). It never sends SetFIDTokenValues. We answered 0x11 with "unknown id" (0x05) and
#     reported General options=0x2000. One of those replies is very likely why the head unit
#     rejects IDPS. This round isolates which.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL_APP_BIT = 1 << 0x0D   # 0x2000 — "communication with iPhone OS 3.x applications"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ROUND 2 RESULTS (runs 20260811_1229-1232, R1-R5) — the transID echo was the unlock, and it moved
# the wall exactly one step. With echo_transid the ~18s option stalls VANISHED (0x4b queries now
# resolve <0.1s apart) and the head unit proceeded to send its own SetFIDTokenValues (0x39) — the
# FID-token step that never appeared before. Its tokens even include the EA protocol strings
# (jp.co.honda.rd.dispaudio.app.hondalink, com.pandora.link.v1). R3/R5 (0x11 ACK, extra lingo
# options) behaved identically to R2 and R4 (speculative 0x12) no better — so the 0x11 answer and
# option bits DON'T matter; only the transID echo did.
#
# THE NEW WALL: after we ACK the FID tokens (0x3a, which correctly echoes the transID), the head
# unit goes silent for ~18s (again 3x its 6s retry unit) and then sends EndIDPS with
# accEndIDPSStatus=0x01 (still FAIL) — transID 0x0009, i.e. the very next counter value with nothing
# between. So it sends its tokens, starts an ~18s timer waiting for the iPod to act, and finalizes
# with fail when nothing comes. The most likely missing iPod action is INITIATING MFi device
# authentication (GetDevAuthenticationInfo) right after the token exchange — which our code never
# did, because it only initiated auth after EndIDPS returned status 0x00 (a state we never reach).
# Round 3 breaks that chicken-and-egg with `auth_trigger`, plus a `force_idps_success` escape hatch.
